  Personal Blog made with Gatsby + TailwindCss
</h1>

<h3>I made this project for learning both Gatsby and Tailwind. </h3>
<h3>Demo: https://gatsby-personal-blog.vercel.app</h3>

<p>
  This is a personal blog website example. You can easily add posts with uploading markdown(.md) files in github and build project again.
  <br>
  <b>You can use it for yourself with forking this project. </b>
  <br>
  I used <a href="https://vercel.com/">vercel.com</a> for building project. You need to add your project url(import project) to vercel and it will automatically build your project and publish it.
  <br>
  Best thing of building with vercel like websites is that when you change anything, I mean push a new commit, it will be re-builded again and published. 
  <br>
 So when I add new post(s) with a new commit, It will be re-builded and published. So you can add/remove/modify your posts without any database, login panel etc. It is easy as just using github.

<h4>My thoughts about Gatsby </h5>
<ul>
  <li> This is the first time I experience with graphql. If you need a structure like backend quickly and easily, Gatsby with graphql is so useful.</li>
  <li> The only thing I am not okey with graphql is that you can not use variables in your query. So I could not filter querys with keywords; I had to do it with getting all data and filtering it in code.</li>
  <li> I think I could use Gatsby's features better. With a good layout and linking, I could make the code better. </li>
</ul>

<h4>My thoughts about Tailwind </h5>
<ul>
  <li> Why did not I use it early?</li>
  <li> Tailwind provides easy and responsive styling. </li>
  <li> Installation is a little more confusing if you used other frameworks(bootstrap etc.). But you would see that it is actually not. </li>
  <li> I think this is not a good project to test tailwind's other advantages. But I saw the benefits and probably I will use tailwind more often. </li>
</ul>
